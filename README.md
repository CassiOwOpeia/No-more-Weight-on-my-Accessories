# No more Weight on my Accessories

## Description

"No more Weight on my Accessories" is a mod for Project Zomboid that removes the weight of cosmetic items in the game. As the name suggests, this mod allows players to enjoy cosmetic items without the burden of their weight, considering them purely aesthetic additions to gameplay.

## Features

- Removes weight from cosmetic items.

## How It Works

This mod identifies all items marked as "cosmetic" within Project Zomboid and nullifies their weight. Rather than individually modifying each vanilla game item, which would be time-consuming and incompatible with other mods adding cosmetic items, this mod takes a universal approach to ensure compatibility and efficiency.
